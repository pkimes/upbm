\title{RMA Normalization of Samples}
\usage{
rmaNormalize(se, .force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{SummarizedExperiment object containing PBM intensity data}

\item{.force}{logical whether to run normalization even if data
has already been normalized within arrays. (default = FALSE)}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment object with normalized intensities.
}
\description{
Given PBM intensities stored as a SummarizedExperiment, this function
performs RMA-style normalization on each sample (currently, only quantile
normalization is supported) and returns thesame SummarizedExperiment object
with the normalized intensities.
