\title{Create a new PBMDesign object}
\usage{
PBMDesign(object, ...)

\S4method{PBMDesign}{data.frame}(object, ...)

\S4method{PBMDesign}{DataFrame}(object, ...)

\S4method{PBMDesign}{PBMExperiment}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a data.frame with each row corresponding to a probe on the array.
Must include `Sequence' and (unique) `probeID' columns, along with any
other metadata for probes, e.g. array `Row' or `Column' spatial coordinates.
Alternatively, a \code{\link[=PBMExperiment-class]{PBMExperiment}} object to
return the associated \code{PBMDesign} object.}

\item{...}{optional probe design parameters to be defined as part of the \code{PBMDesign}
object. See the \code{\link[=PBMDesign-class]{PBMDesign}} class definition for
a list of probe design parameters. Important parameters are as described in
the Details section below.}
}
\value{
\code{PBMDesign} object.
}
\description{
Create a new PBMDesign object of protein binding microarray probe design information.
Alternatively, the function can be called on a PBMExperiment to extract the
probe design information associated with experimental data.
}
\details{
Probe design parameters can be specified by name. The following are a couple important
parameters which are defined by default for universal PBM designs in the \pkg{upbmAux}
package.
\enumerate{
\item \code{probeFilter}: optional named list of probe filters to be used to subset
probes during data analysis steps. List names must correspond to columns in `design'.
List entries must be single-parameter functions to be called on the corresponding column
to return a logical vector of probes to keep (TRUE) and drop (FALSE) during analysis.
\item \code{probeTrim}: optional integer vector of length 2 specifying start and end
positions in probe `Sequence' to use in analysis steps.
