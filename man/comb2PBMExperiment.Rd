\title{Combinatorial Files to PBMExerpiment Object}
\usage{
comb2PBMExperiment(tab, probes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{data.frame with at least a single \code{combn} column
corresponding to PBM "combinatorial.txt" file paths.}

\item{probes}{data.frame containing probe sequences in a column, 'Sequence',
or a character vector specifying the probe sequences. If specified,
these values will be added to the rowData of the returned
SummarizedExperiment object. (default = NULL)}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment object containing PBM data.
}
\description{
Helper function to read in a set of combinatorial files generated by
the Universal PBM Analysis Suite into a format similar to raw PBM
data read using \code{buildPBMExerpiment}.
}
\details{
If a \code{name} column is included in the input table, these are used as the
corresponding IDs for each sample/row. If IDs are not provided, the
file names are used. Sample IDs must be unique, and an error is thrown
if any samples have a common ID.
All other columns (aside from \code{combn} and \code{name}) in \code{tab} will be added to
the \code{colData} of the returned SummarizedExperiment object. Any sample
information, e.g. replicate or condition information can be included in
\code{tab}.
